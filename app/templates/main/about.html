                <p id="about-info">The goal of WomensActivism.NYC is to create a permanent New York City archive listing
                    women from around the globe who made a difference through their activism and, in turn, inspire
                    activism today. The women described in the archive may be famous or largely unknown. They may have
                    lived in the past or may still be working today. The only requirements are: they must be
                    woman-identified and they must have contributed to making change in some way.</p>

                <p id="about-info">This initiative began in 2015 as part of a celebration of women’s activism connected
                    to the Suffrage Centennial. The NYC Department of Records and Information Services created
                    WomensActivism.NYC to honor the anniversary of women winning the right to vote in New York State in
                    1917 and in the United States in 1920. We’re writing everyday extraordinary women into #herstory.
